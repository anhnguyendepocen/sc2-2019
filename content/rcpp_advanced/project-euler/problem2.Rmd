title: "Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers"
---

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \ldots$$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

<summary>A Solution</summary>

Let $F_1, F_2, \ldots$ denote the (non-standard) Fibonnaci sequence with $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 2$. Then, for each integer $n \geq 2$,
$$F_{n+1} = F_{n-1} + F_n.$$

We create a vector `fibs` of Fibonacci numbers (starting from 1 and 2) less than 4 million.

```{r}
fibs <- c(1, 2)
n <- 2 # length of fibs
x <- fibs[1] + fibs[2] # value of the next Fibonacci number
while (x < 4e6) {
  n <- n + 1
  fibs <- c(fibs, x)
  x <- fibs[n-1] + fibs[n]
}
fibs
```

We sum all the numbers in `fibs` that are even to get the result.

```{r}
s <- sum(fibs[fibs %% 2 == 0])
s
```
