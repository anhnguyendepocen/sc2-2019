R is a [high-level programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language) that is popular for statistical computing.

It is strongly recommended that you use the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) integrated development environment (IDE). To use this, first download and install R from the [R project website](https://www.r-project.org/). Then [download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and install the *Open Source License* version of **RStudio Desktop**.
